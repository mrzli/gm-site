# Atomic Habits

[https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)

## Fundamentals

Power of atomic habits is in **compound effect**.  

Focus on systems and identity change, not goals.  
First step - decide who you want to be.  
Second step - take small steps to **reinforce your desired identity**, and let habits-identity feedback loop run.

Build better habits.  
Habits free up your time and mental capacity - they make actions automatic.  
Habit loop has four steps: cue, craving, response, reward.

Use **four laws** to improve you habit forming process on each of the four steps.    
The four laws are: obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying.  
Use **inverse of four laws** to reduce negative habits.  

## 1st Law - Obvious

Increase the chance of noticing a cue and raise your awareness by using a **habit scorecard**.

### Starting a New Habit

#### Implementation intention.  

Cue is a time and place.  

> I will BEHAVIOR at TIME in LOCATION.

Be specific.

#### Habit Stacking

Existing habit is your cue.  

> After CURRENT HABIT, I will NEW HABIT.

Be specific.  
Don't try to put the habit where it does not fit.  

======

Change environment.  
Change environment to facilitate habit change.  
Also change context - association with objects, places, etc.

Avoiding bad habits.
Don't rely on willpower and discipline.  
Make cues invisible - inverse of first law.

## 2nd Law - Attractive

Make a habit attractive. Make it irresistible.

#### Temptation bundling

Link a habit you want with what you already like.  
Optionally use habit stacking

> After CURRENT HABIT, I will HABIT I NEED. (optional)  
> After HABIT I NEED, I will HABIT I WANT.  

======

We tend to imitate those close to us, the majority and the powerful.  
Family, friends, and others have a great impact on our habits.  

### Fix Causes of Bad Habits

Craving on the surface is a manifestation of a deeper underlying motive.  
Habits latch on existing deeper motives, the don't create new ones.  
You can replace old habits with new (better) habits that satisfy those motives.

#### How?

Associate habits with positive feelings.  
Think of them as an opportunity, not burden.  
Highlight benefits, not drawbacks.  

As a step further, practice a **motivational ritual**.  
Use it for getting into 'game mode'.  
Train your mind to achieve desired result (result like having focus).  
Can be adopted for many purposes, for example for triggering feelings of happiness.

## 3rd Law - Easy

#### Do, Don't Just Think

Don't just think (do the motions).  
Thinking is necessary, but not sufficient.  

Repeat, don't try to be perfect.  
Repetition is the important thing, not duration of trying.

#### Use Least Effort

Do habits the easiest way, with least friction and cognitive load - make the right thing easy.  
Use environment design (as with cues). This will reduce cognitive load and/or make things easy.  
Prime the environment for future use. Do the opposite of actions you want to avoid. 

#### Two-minute Rule

Use a vey quick habit (which is used as a decisive/entry point). It can set you on the right path for hours.  

Scale down at start.
Maybe just do some preparatory action for a habit.  
Or try doing a very short version of the habit (something doable in 'two minutes').  

Progress incrementally after that.

#### Make Good Habits Inevitable, Bad Habits Impossible

Use a commitment device - use will power in the present to lock in future actions (or lock out for bad habits).  
Use automation (tech).  
Use one-time actions with long-term effects.

## 4th Law - Satisfying

### Behavior Change

Make habits satisfying, make reward immediate.  

When dealing with habits of avoidance (trying to avoid bad habit), try to make such action into something active and satisfying.  

Short term rewards should be aligned with what you want to achieve, not work against it.  
For example, reward for doing an exercise could be a massage instead of an ice-cream.

Long term rewards will eventually kick in alongside short term rewards that got you here.

### Sticking With Good Habits

#### Habit Tracking

You can use for example use real objects for counting, or you can use technology.  
Benefits are: visual cue as a reminder, motivating because you can see progress, satisfying when you record execution.  
Downsides is that it is essentially another habit that you need to adopt.  

How to do it?  
Automate if possible.  
Limit what you track.  
Record immediately after habit is done.  
Implement using habit stacking ('After HABIT I will TRACK.').

======

Recover from broken streaks, avoid perfectionism.  

Be careful what you measure.  
Don't measure the wrong thing. For example, we often try to measure something that is easy to measure.  
Avoid making measurement the target.

### Accountability

Increase the speed of punishment for bad behavior - pain is corrective.  
Make habit contracts.  
Have an accountability partner (which is a less radical version of the above).

## Advanced - From Good to Great

### Genes and Talent

#### Find what Suits You

Find your fit, physically and psychologically.  
Don't just do things that other say you should do.  
There is a version of every habit that is suited for you.  
Once you find a habit that suits you, it is easy to do, and progress is fast. It will create a virtuous cycle.

#### Picking the Right Habit

Avoid trial and error. Use instead explore/exploit. More exploring at the beginning, more exploiting later on.  
Create your own game, combine skills, specialize.

### Goldilocks rule

Be on the edge of ability, between boredom and anxiety.  
Use variable reward.  
In the end, accept boredom.

### Downsides of Habits

#### Automation Related

Once an action is automatic, you stop improving.  
This is ok for some habits which you do not need to master, but not ideal for others.  

Use deliberate practice to overcome plateaus, and in combination with habits - to achieve mastery.  

Review performance, reflect, remain conscious of performance.  
Use decision journal. Write down why you decided something, what you expected, and what the result was. Review at end of month of year.  
Use annual review. Use integrity report.  
How often to do this? Not too often, not never.

#### Identity Related

Getting stuck in an identity is an obstacle to finding better paths.  
Try not to make an aspect of your identity too important, especially impermanent or fragile one. If you do, when lost, you will pay a big price.

### Summary of Everything

Make incremental improvements, and compound them.  
Focus on system, not the goal.  
Use the four rules: obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying.  
Keep improving.
